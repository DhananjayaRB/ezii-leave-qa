# eziileave - Leave Management System

## Overview

eziileave is a comprehensive leave management system built as a full-stack application with Express.js backend and React frontend. The application uses PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for data persistence and integrates with Replit's authentication system. It provides role-based access control for admins and employees to manage leave applications, compensatory off, PTO, holidays, and approval workflows.

## Business Logic Considerations

### Slab System and Variable Month Lengths
The system handles varying month lengths (28, 29, 30, 31 days) in pro-rata calculations:
- Slab thresholds are based on **calendar days worked**, not working days
- February: maximum 28/29 calendar days possible
- 30-day months: maximum 30 calendar days possible  
- 31-day months: maximum 31 calendar days possible
- Slab criteria remain fixed regardless of month length variations
- **Critical Issue**: Thresholds set too high (e.g., 30 days) cannot be met in February, resulting in 0 leave earning
- **Business Impact**: Employees lose earning opportunity in shorter months
- **Solutions**: 
  1. Keep all thresholds â‰¤ 28 days for consistency
  2. Implement proportional calculation (30-day threshold becomes 28 in February: 30/30 = 28/28)
- **UI Warning**: System highlights thresholds > 28 days as "Unachievable in February"
